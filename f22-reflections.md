## Week 2, 10/02/2022

### Weekly Goals
- [X] Develop skills on learning how to read a research paper
- [X] Develop more understanding about research topic and terminology
- [] Establish a research question to frame focus for the upcoming weeks
- [X] Familiarize self with V-Lab setup and people
- [X] Read over a research paper on Symbolic Execution to become more familiar with research topic

__Tuesday, October 4 Time Spent: 1.5 Hours__
- [X] Read over Differential Symbolic Execution research paper by Person, Dwyer, Elbaum
   - Notes: https://github.com/Jumshim/ersp-22-reflection-logs/blob/main/cs110-research-activities/research_first_pass.md
__Monday, October 3 Time Spent: 1 Hour__
- [X] Attend VLab Meeting at meet research time with Professor Bultan
- [X] Read over slides on Symbolic Execution (25-35)
   - **Symbolic State** : maps variables to symbolic values
   - Programs are run on symbolic values
   - **Path Condition** is a quantifier-free formula that encodes all branch decisions taken so far
      - When using math operators (+, -, *, /, <, >, = ...), checks if they are valid programs. Are they both integers?
      - All paths form a program's execution tree which deem certain paths as feasible and others unfeasible


__Sunday, October 2 Time Spent: 1 hour__
- [X] Establish Meeting Time
- [X] Read and Take Notes on "How to Read an Engineering Research Paper
   - Research paper outline:
      - Introduction states motivations and outlines solution
      - Body: author's solution to a problem and detailed evaluation of solution
      - Recap: Dicussion of primary contributions
   - Important Questions to Keep in Mind:
      - What are the motivations? Unstated people problem vs technical problem? Why o we not have a trivial solution yet? What are our solutions?
      - What is the proposed solution? How is it achieved and what makes it better than the status quo?
      - Evaluation of Proposed solution? Make the case for the idea
      - Analysis of Identified Problem: Pros, Cons, Flaws, Benefits, Arguments,...
      - What are the contributions? Ideas, software, techniques are also included in contributions
      - What are future directions?
      - Leftover questions? Future takeaways?

## Week 1, 09/26/2022

### Weekly Goals
- [ ] Become friends with project-mates
- [ ] Successfully onboard required materials to begin research proposal brainstorming

__Thursday, September 29 - Time Spent: 1.5 Hours__
- [X] Established boundaries and communicated with teammates
- [X] Made a cute group chat so we can communicate
- [X] Organized first meeting time to finish research preparation and the offical main meeting (Next Wednesday, October 5 from 5:00-7:00 PM)
   - Established smaller meeting times where everyone is available for mentor meetings
   - Preferred modes of communication established

__Tuesday, September 28 - Time Spent: 2 Hours__
- [X] Wednesday Pre-Class Assignments
  -   Initialized research logs: Chose to write my logs on Github to force myself to learn proper git flow, markdown language, and repository management
  -   Wrote reflections
  -   Read through the ERSP contract and signed the consent forms
- [X] Answer Reflection-Log Questions

__First Log Reflection__

How did the logs differ in style (not just in content)? What advantages do you see in one style over another?
- From reading through the sample reflection logs, they each differred in the format, writing style, and organization. The main difference in format I noticed was the choice between Github Markdown Pages and a typical Google Docs format. Each of the stylistic design choices were also unique to each person (colors, pictures, bold, headers, etc...), showing that these effort should be put into these reflection logs to make them individualized projects. The writing style also changed person to person, some kept it short and simple while others took the time to write a whole diary entry. Finally, in terms of organization, every ERSP reflection log had similar requirements (goals, reflections, tasks, time spent, date ...) but the way they were synthesized onto a page was different. 
- For the advantages of the style, I think it just depends on the person. Google Docs versus Github Markdown both have their respective pros-and-cons (familiarity and usability vs challenging and learning). Bullet-point-esque and diary reflection logs just reflect how a person thinks and mirrors a person's thoughts onto paper.

How do you think the logs were useful, both to the researcher as well as those working with the researcher?
- Keeping an organized system of reflection is useful in almost every scenario, but writing logs in a research standpoint adds more focus, critical thinking, and back-traceable history. Just think about it, writing about one's thoughts isn't easy. For a researcher, just remembering about what they had done, what inspired some emotions they felt, and what conflicts happened forces them to grow individually and revisit important topics which would have disappeared as an afterthought. For those working with the researcher having these logs enables a better working environment as well as an orderly system of tracking goals and progress. 

Did the students keeping their logs seem to meet their goals? Did they get better at meeting their goals over time?
 - The students did seem to meet their goals! Of course the zealousness of the reflections and effort put in started to drop off as more time in the year progressed, but I am pretty sure they managed to accomplish as much as they wanted to. Whenever there was an unfinished goal, they just pushed it to the following week (of course for bigger goals this happened more and more frequently as time progressed), but I'm sure they accomplished what they wanted to do.
 
What makes me most excited about ERSP, and why?
- The #1 bringer of excitement is the chance to meet more friends. I have not had too many opportunities to meet many engineering majors, so the fact that I will be spending so much time with the same people, through struggles and triumphs, is a very warm thought. 

What makes me the most nervous about ERSP, and why?
- The #1 bringer of anxiety to me is the fear of not having enough time. What if I choose a research direction which is millions of times more complex than I anticipated? What if I do not vibe with my teammates? What if I am forced to choose between two of my favorite commitments because a day is only 24 hours?
